# Challenge Decoder - Oracle ONE - ALURA LATAM
This is our first challenge in this course.
#challengeonedecodificador4

### Note
Our goal is to make a website that encrypt/decrypt a message using the keys:
- The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
- The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

### Requirements:
- It should only work with lowercase letters (I've changed to convert to lowercase)
- Letters with accents or special characters must not be used (I've changed to remove special accents)
- It must be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version and also return an encrypted word to the original version.
